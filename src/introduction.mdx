# Introduction

A minimal starter repository for a publishable React based UI library. Uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for story based development. Comes setup with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The focus is on making sure the developer experience is the best while building with this repository.

## Features

- Story based development using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
- Comes setup for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) development. Can be easily switched out to support other frameworks.
- Git Hooks using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) that lint and run tests before changes are pushed.
- Source Code Lint using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- Commit Message linting with [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint). Setup to use the [conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional) style of commit messages.
- To help developers automatically write good commit messages, [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is fully setup to use the conventional style of commit messages.
  - Additionally, [devmoji](https://github.com/folke/devmoji) has been setup to emojify commit messages. These are also setup as a `prepare-commit-msg` git hook. If you wish to remove it, please update `.husky/prepare-commit-msg` and `package.json`.
- Release with [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release). If you use a proper [Commit Message format](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format), you'll never have to manually version and publish NPM packages again.
- Test with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- Builds using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).
- GitHub Action to build and release to NPM automatically.

## Usage

Once published to your private or public NPM, you can install and use this library in any React project.
If you use TailwindCSS, use the `./src/tailwind.preset.ts` file to do all your customization. This file is used by both the library, the Storybook and is also exported for use in your project.

In your `tailwind.config.ts` file, import the preset and use it as follows (just an example):

```ts
import { type Config } from 'tailwindcss'
import tailwindPreset from '~/LIBRARY/tailwind.preset'

export default {
  ...,
  presets: [
    // Custom Tailwind Preset. This will be part of the exported package - which can then be easily imported into child projects
    tailwindPreset,
  ],
  ...,
} satisfies Config
```
